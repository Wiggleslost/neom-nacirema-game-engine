Steam pre-work

The game engine is being developed for Steam as there will be much more information available for Steam and as much knowledge 
for the purpose of just bringing Nacirema into Steam and eventually other platforms for the purpose of learning from Steam
into another platform, not much info will available regarding other platforms as the game is just currently beginning to 
form for Steam

The current game engine does not appear to be working as the program will possibly need information in here for a complete 
overhaul and any missing information will try to be inputted in this part of the site for saved information regarding the
steps taken to provide a future developer information about what steps to take in case the current game engine is not
functioning correctly as the game engine how it works is probably stable; however weirder things have been seen, so
having written documents is necessary just in case there are missing files that were previously in the game engine
for the purpose of running the game in Steam and other devices such as PC or Mac

The game will most likely only be developed for Steam alone with giving other platforms information in here and from
Steam for file transfer for the game to run on other platforms. The pre-work and thoughts about the ins and outs of
the game are very difficult to comprehend and felt that the gaming world needs an original game, the game will be 
an original game and the information is currently sparse as far as installing or running the game, future information
will be available in here as a guide if you are looking to install the game on your Pc or Mac depending upon what
device you have available to use for installation, the files will have to be granted from Steam in order for players
that wish to play on a PC or Mac. The wonderful system in Steam does allow small bits of information regarding info
on how to run the game on your device

The pre-thought with previous limited experience with the game engine led me to the conclusion that the game engine 
that is available in Steam for purchase is possibly not functioning correctly, this could be misinformation as 
the game template has not been formed yet, so the assumption is that we will integrate the paid game engine into
possible game engine you can buy in the future because of past experience another game engine called the
"Creation Engine" was bought and seen as the same functioning engine Steam is using hence the possibility of 
a non-functional game engine that Steam cannot use that is something that is hoped that that will not be the 
case when the game is started to be developed, the basic idea if that is the case that the "Creation Engine" 
is interferring with the game engine, a basic exe file will be implemented for the purpose of not allowing 
another company to interfere with Steam not getting paid if the game engine cannot be seen or have a provided 
screenshot that is so important having screenshot information from the game that having another engine showing
as the game engine defeats the purpose and explaining that another company does not run Steam, the game engine 
is truly what runs Steam that Steam created the game engine, these are just pre-cautions being thought prior 
to building the game completely for Steam and players enjoyment
