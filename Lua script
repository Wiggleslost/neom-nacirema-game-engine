Lua script

The programming language that is possibly seen in the game engine will be Lua scripting that not much is currently known about
the scripting yet; however the scripting text appears like here in GitHub

Names for Lua script

1. Lua programming language
2. Lua script
3. Lua transcript
4. Lua tablet language
5. Lua transmission
6. Etc.

The multiple names that can be used for understanding the upcoming information that will be provided later on as the programming language 
is known as C++ that does not make sense though for Lua because the non-paid site Letnie is the basic only known coding language for
L+ hence those seeking knowledge from information such as the letter L in Lua, makes more sense that the programming language would be
known as in the coding language L+ that is easy to understand what a group of people want to call a certain type of gaming language such
as the majority uses the language of C++ as the normal or lamen term for a coding language used in a program

Lua scripting has been developed from Roberto Ierusalimschy that I will want to buy just about every book available for the purpose of 
understanding the language that is being written in the game engine. I will most likely take over the Lua scripting in the game engine
as it has been heard that the developer of the original game engine has moved onto another game engine, would be nice to eventually meet
some of the people who built these programs that is awesome to know that the Lua scripting has been developed by Catholics that is a 
wonderful thing because I am Catholic! 

The game name Neom I: Nacirema has just been written inside the game engine on 1-31-2026 as written records are a fun part learning
about the different tools available for use in creating such a thing as a video game. The knowledge is beyond comprehension and the
programming language is believed to be the choice for the future game series in Neom those of you guys getting involved will start
to understand why Saudi Arabia uses the name Neom as the principle learning tool for the surrounding countries, you do not know if
the neighboring countries even understand what a line is in real life? The belief is that the game series will help build skills
inside and outside of the programming language that the first game is assumed to appear like older video game graphics that will be
molded later on into life like animations in the later game series of Neom

2nd introduction to possible programming language, the belief that two programming languages have to be available is a difficult thing to swallow,
here in GitHub is the only piece of information that we have that are struggling to accomplish in the Neom Game Series and related games to the
series and future games that are also related to the Neom Game Series. You cannot use both languages, the purpose of this second introduction
of what programming language will be used is for the purpose of the whole group that will be using the specific programming language
written for the game, the current information with Steam is confusing, the company is a living company, and the possibility that the
company will close is a possible scenario that no one wants to encounter in thought, so users will want to hold onto this information
on what programming language (script) will be used for the game engine

I am introducing another script that not many have knowledge in the programming language for the purpose just in case Steam does close
the doors that is not the hope that Steam does shut down completely, hopefully that is better understood why the two languages are seen,
don't get your hopes up with one language right away after you read this, there are certain users who cannot know what specific programming
language is used in a game prior to a game being released because if they are a different user of a programming language such as a related
C program, the user that is in C++ might attempt to learn the other language they are not qualified for using the other language program.
The other language being written about in this second segment is called C# that is confusing to some users and not wished to be known as
a language; however C# also known as C sharp has to be known because if Steam does shut down, this information will become more valuable
if in the case that Steam does shut down C# will become the programming script used for the game engine

C# is easy to understand as DLR otherwise known as Dynamic Language Runtime that is the basic programming language that I understand as
what Apple uses as the programming language, years have past from school where Apple computers were used as the learning tool with early 
games that had files in games like Oregon Trail, the game files these days are different than from years past, and the files have to be
understood in order for a program to function as intended. The reason why C# is needed to be studied is because Steam has a different 
operating system than Apple and Microsoft. The importance of C# is that the town of Neom uses C# as the programming language seen in their
on-board computers that are used for communicating information where the United States and Saudi Arabia can communicate between each 
other through the various servers that exist in the world such as Saudia Arabia communicating with Israel or Egypt for example, the other
two countries are unknown as to what programming language is mainly used in their computer systems, the recent past information about 
Saudi Arabia brings understanding for both programming languages, the point of going with the same programming language is a good idea
and should be considered if things like the possibility of Steam closing the doors on their devices is a sad truth that the devices
have little value if the company chooses to shut down the company that is most likely not the case; however planning has to be implemented
in order for electronics to function properly, so study inside the Steam devices are necessary for the purpose of having a functional 
game in the future, all of the files have to be available for an available game to be played

The DLR is not really understood yet by me personally as I have had small bits of experience with Apple devices such as iPhone and iPad devices
that are not really devices that should be used as a file witholding cell. DLR needs functional files as this is just pre-writing before
the actual game engine is fully functioning for players like you to be able to play Nacirema in the future, so I will try to communicate 
all the information I know in order for you to succeed in contributing with the first game and hope that you will continue to help with
the future games as well. The first information I would like to communicate is about Steam that is good knowledge to have with the founding
people of Steam. The names are not listed for their own protection because a name cannot be written about in a negative form. The only 
information that I will communicate is the imaginary name Harry is a Microsoft programmer whereas Noo is an Apple programmer, do you see the 
importance of knowing that the two have combined both Microsoft and Apple knowledge to form a new operating system, when a company closes
the doors, the information about a product becomes very difficult to understand and almost impossible to recover files as intellectual
property is theirs because they created the operating system, no user can take away the Steam operating system except for the ones who
actually created the operating system and that is the reason for preparing for the unknown even though you might not receive every little
bit of information that you will understand in this second segment, the importance of understanding that the time they have spent creating
the operating system for Steam will always be held valuable even if important information is missing, written information is needed for 
the purpose of future functionality in a game, so this information is a valid form to understand how GitHub is the ultimate underground
in file information, having a functional game takes many devices to function the game and offline studies have to be implemented now in
order for the system to work

The current game engine known that will be used, uncertain if the Leadwerks engine will be actually used because of the engine previously
paid for, so this information is important just in case Steam does close the doors on developers, where would we go to have information
about different programming languages, we would not be able to live if information like this were not available. The game engine was 
previously paid for; however when installed, the game engine would not function properly, what I am referring about is that when attempting
to launch the game engine, the engine typewriter did not function as intended, the intended text could not be inputted, so when the engine
is paid for again, the trial and error will have to be explored again that is a migraine buying something, and the engine not functioning 
properly, irritating as you probably can imagine if you paid for a product, and the product not working. I would like to explain that 
I had previously paid for a system in Elder Scrolls Online earlier with the intentions of developing a new game series in Elder Scrolls
Online; however the two names were not fully accepted, so here I am programming another thing called an app in Steam that is hoped to 
move to other gaming companies such as PlayStation and Xbox. You can choose two basic game engines in gaming from past experience and
knowledge of the two gaming engines available that should be able to work in case Steam does shut down, I am not sold on the consoles 
out of stock currently along with unsure information about a potential Steam Machine, without a product, a company cannot exist 
unfortunately, the actual Steam Deck consoles should still be available to function as intended if you literally paid for a device,
the difference in a vaild product if you paid for a device or have not paid for a device

The operating system of a Steam Deck otherwise known as a Steam Console is the same basic product with the other known product known
as the Steam Machine that is only available as a basic hardrive, all of this information is being communicated because I really have
only known how Steam works and do not want to change from working with Steam. Hopefully this is really seen why I am writing this
information for the purpose that the Neom Game Series can be played anywhere in the world such as Saudia Arabia or the United States.
The assumption is to go with what is presented as the programming language of choice, do you see the importance of following another
place in order for a system to work? The game presentation is easier understood as Saudi Arabia has figured out the site Neom Land 
that is an important connection for the game series that is now related to other literature in the United States and Saudi Arabia and
possible other parts of the world. The operating system of the Steam Deck is a basic two-screen console that the Steam Library and the
operating system that can transmit game file information, the knowledge about the two sides of the screen can be learned by the
two shapes that have been presented as the foundation of the town Neom that is the Oxagon and the shape for the Neom Game Series is 
the Heptagon, the entirety of the math shapes do have value for both; however the shapes are not the most important part of the 
system process, an operating system has to be understood inside and outside that is the valuable information that is needed for 
the Neom Game Series to be functional that leads over to the operating system you choose whether or not you choose the Unity Engine
or Unreal Engine

Players have to choose one or the other engine of choice if you are deciding to continue a Steam device in the case Steam does shut down,
past experience explains that Elder Scrolls Online uses Unreal Engine whereas the town of Neom uses Unity Engine. The two engines are
both good engines, you have to choose one or the other in case of a shut down, the hope is that Steam will not shut down

New information has surfaced about a new Steam Deck called the Steam Deck 2, don't get your hopes up yet though because the new Steam 
Machine is being built that takes over first before a new Steam Deck can be introduced, upsetting about the different models of the new
Steam Machine being introduced that is confusing, the company cannot yet call both products such as the Steam Machine and Steam Deck a 
all in one Steam Deck 2 or Steam Machine 2, there is a separation of users that is not fully known to why they are trying to introduce
a new Steam Machine that does not appear like a box, the other versions that are being presented are a flatter more hard drive appearing
console, there would have to be two user interfaces in Steam that is not assumed to be a kosher system as one user interface is only
known in every computer system, the information is becoming better understood, so by the time the 1st quarter ends, the company should
have enough knowledge to present in the main site of Steam for an educated decision what will be available to the public and what the
company will present first, if the Steam Deck 2 is presented first that is just a confusion, all the information about the two can be 
written; however less money will be brought into the company. The first generation Steam Decks are an important part of Steam and for
whatever reason the Steam Decks will possibly not be sold again is unknown to me, the assumption is that the Steam Deck 2 will be the
original design of the Steam Deck just because of misinformation inputted into the main site of Steam that appears like from an 
underground source that was not approved by Valve that is the company that manufactures Steam products, just how the company works
