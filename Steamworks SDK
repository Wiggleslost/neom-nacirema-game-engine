Steamworks SDK

The Software Development Kit known as the SDK in Steam that helps users see some of the features of the game that is a basic design
that helps allow uploading desired information about the game. 

List of some features

1. glmgr - The term "glmgr" does not have a current definition that is only referenced as the "ToGL" tool that is possibly seen
as the toggle mechanism inside that communicates between DirectX to OpenGL that can be seen in repo:ValveSoftware/ToGL 

2. public/steam - The Steamworks API official support is C++

3. redistributable_bin - Windows, macOS, and Linux are the 3 redistributable files that can be placed into folders of your choice,
choosing what computer redistributable file is suggested to choose the above device you own for relevant files to be placed into
your folder

4. Steamworks API Application - requirements (Visual Studio 2005 or newer, DirectX SDK, and Steamworks SDK most current file)

*more information will be written later as this is a good template for myself and others while developing the game
